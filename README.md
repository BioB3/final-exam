# How to run my program
- create a gen_art object with the desired amount of art
- use object.initiate() to start generating art

I think I have correctly implemented all the code, but there're some parts that I thought I could improve. Such as, when you enter any number not in the range of 1 - 8, it will simply show you void. And you can actually set how many loop you want the art of the 5,6,7,8 type have, but I haven't make the program ask the user for it yet, so if you want to, you have to change it in the initiate function.
